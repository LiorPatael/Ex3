This project is a implementation to  directed weighted data structure and graph algorithms using Python Programming language. We will devide the README to 3 parts - 
DiGraph class,GraphAlgo class and comparisons between this assignment (using Python) to the previous (using Java)

# Part I - DiGraph class (implements GraphInterface):
 This class implements GraphInterface 
MORE DATA WILL PROVIDED

# Part II - GraphAlgo class (implements GraphAlgoInterface):
  This class implements GraphAlgoInterface
  MORE DATA WILL PROVIDED
