This project is a implementation to  directed weighted data structure and graph algorithms using Python Programming language. We will devide the README to 3 parts - 
DiGraph class,GraphAlgo class and comparisons between this assignment (using Python) to the previous (using Java)

# Part I - DiGraph class (implements GraphInterface):
 This class implements GraphInterface 
MORE DATA WILL PROVIDED

# Part II - GraphAlgo class (implements GraphAlgoInterface):
  This class implements GraphAlgoInterface
  MORE DATA WILL PROVIDED
  
# Part III - Comparisons:
In this part we compare our algorithms between our Ex2 assignment algorithms that we build in java - [CLICK HERE TO SEE THE PREVIOUS ASSIGNMENT](https://github.com/MightyArty/Ex2_Graphs)
